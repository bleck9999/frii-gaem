Some games I ~~made~~ recreated in c++ because why not

## Random.hpp
credit to [Effolkronium](https://github.com/effolkronium/) for the random library ~~mostly just used it because stdlib random scares me~~

## Snake 
its a snake, wasd to move, touch tail get dead, pls dont get >=200 points because undefined behaviour

## Pong 
w and s move player 1, up and down arrows move player 2 ~~you might blame some of the game's flaws on bad code, but its exactly like every other game of pong i've played so shut~~
